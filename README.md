# Telecoupling
 
This is code I worked on with coauthors for a [study](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art3/) on how landscape ecology tools can be used to study distant interactions. In this case study, we used network analysis and a few other tools to understand the global soy trade and its effect on pantropical deforestation.
